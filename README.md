# NABU-PC-FDC-and-HDMI-Backplate
This backplate for the NABU PC allows floppy drive connection to the NABU FDC and also HDMI passthrough

This is a modification of the project created by Classic_computer_workshop on Thingiverse: https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:5931563

I have modified this project (using FreeCAD) to allow for an HDMI panel-mount passthrough connection in addition to the FDC cutout
